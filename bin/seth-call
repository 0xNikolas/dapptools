### seth-call -- call a contract without updating the blockchain
### Usage: seth call [-a <account>] [-b <block>] <receiver> [<calldata>]
### Perform a local call to <receiver> without creating a transaction.
###
### With `-a <account>', simulate calling <receiver> from <account>
### With `-b <block>', use the state of the blockchain as of <block>.
### With `-v <value>', simulate transferring <value> to <receiver>.
###
### If no <calldata> is given, read it from standard input instead.

receiver=`seth check-blob "${1?missing receiver}"`
calldata=`seth check-blob ${2+"$2"}`
