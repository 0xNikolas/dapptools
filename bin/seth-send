### seth-send -- publish a transaction to the blockchain
### Usage: seth send [-a <account>] [-w <wei>] [<receiver>]
### Publish a transaction making a call to <receiver> from <account>.
### If no <receiver> is given, this creates a new contract instead.
###
### The transaction's calldata is read from standard input.
### With `-w', transfer <wei> to <receiver> (or the new contract).
###
### If no calldata is given, just transfer <wei> to <receiver>.
