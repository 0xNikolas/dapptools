Seth is a command-line client for the Ethereum JSON-RPC API.

Use `make install' to install Seth into `/usr/local'.
Use `make link' to link Seth into `/usr/local' from this directory.

Run `seth help' or `seth <command> --help' for more information.

Seth depends on the following programs:

 * curl(1) <https://curl.haxx.se/>
 * ethabi(1) <https://github.com/ethcore/ethabi/>
 * jshon(1) <http://kmkeen.com/jshon/>
